[x] Add "Programming Language Experience" and "AI Safety Exposure" sections.
[x] Reorganize the "AI Safety Exposure" section to only keep one line of
    explanation and one date range.
[x] Make these bold and nothing else (but leave the header as-is):
    * "using Value Range Analysis to prove the safety of a toy example"
    * "Can we Prove Facts about ML Models via Code Synthesis?"
    * "A programming language guaranteeing that generated code is well-typed."
    * "A programming language with type-driven macros."
    * the highlights (which are already bold)
    * "a language listing server-side and client-side code in the same function"
    * "programming language researcher at MIRI"
