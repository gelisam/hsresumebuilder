      displayName: "Samuel GÃ©lineau"
      jobTitle: "Senior Software Engineer, Architect, and Evangelist"
      locations:
        - "Montreal, Canada"
      shortIntro:
        - "I am a software engineer who specializes in the Functional Programming paradigm and more specifically in Haskell, with which I have 16 years of experience by now. Despite this specialization, I draw from a broad background as I also have professional experience in academic research, distributed systems, embedded systems, entrepreneurship, mobile development, and web development. Throughout those adventures I have been paid to write Bash, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python, Scala, and TypeScript. I also have experience with Agda, Elm, Racket, Rust, and others too obscure to list."
        - "I enjoy spreading the gospel by giving presentations and tutoring sessions on the advantages and disadvantages of various FP idioms, for example combinator libraries, difference lists, free monads, FRP, lenses, and MonadBasedControl vs UnliftIO."
        - "As a result, I have often helped my team compare different ways of approaching a problem, and that has led me to become the lead architect of a team of twenty. One of my priorities in that position was to make sure everybody's opinion was heard, not just mine, as I greatly value communication and collaboration."
